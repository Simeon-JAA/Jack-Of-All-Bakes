# Jack-Of-All-Bakes
Inspired by my hobby of baking, I have created what I would imagine to be a baking website, including recipes, a home page, etc. 

This website was perviously worked on alongside my journey learning to code and is updated as i learn new features to impliment into the code.

Since starting with just html and css my JS has imporved significantly and I have demostrated this implimenting functionality within the webpage.

Diving into responsive web design, I will be using bootstrap on a branch to make this more compatible with smaller devices(instead of lots of media queries).
